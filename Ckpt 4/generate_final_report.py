This report presents the evaluation of different approaches to dietary classification for the LabelSense.AI system. The goal is to accurately classify food products as vegan, vegetarian, or non-vegetarian based on their ingredients list.

LabelSense.AI aims to help consumers make informed dietary choices by analyzing food labels through OCR and natural language processing. The dietary classification component is crucial for users with specific dietary restrictions.

For this checkpoint, we implemented and evaluated three different approaches:
1. A fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer model
2. A rule-based classifier using ingredient keyword matching
3. Integration with OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model

The evaluation metrics focus on classification accuracy, F1 score, and other relevant measures to determine which approach provides the best balance of performance and efficiency for real-world use.

Our approach to dietary classification involved implementing and comparing three different methods:

2.1 RoBERTa Transformer Model
We fine-tuned a RoBERTa-base model for multi-label classification of food ingredients. The model was trained on a dataset of ingredient lists with their corresponding dietary classifications. We used binary cross-entropy loss and trained for 3 epochs with a batch size of 16.

2.2 Rule-Based Classifier
We implemented a simple keyword-based classifier that identifies non-vegan and non-vegetarian ingredients through pattern matching. This approach uses predefined lists of animal-derived ingredients and applies simple logic to determine dietary classifications.

2.3 GPT-4o-mini Integration
We created an API integration with OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model, using prompt engineering to guide the model in analyzing ingredient lists and providing dietary classifications in a structured JSON format. This approach leverages the model's advanced reasoning capabilities without requiring additional training.

2.4 Evaluation Methodology
All models were evaluated on a common test set, with the following metrics:
- Accuracy: Overall classification accuracy
- F1 Score: Weighted F1 score for multi-label classification
- Hamming Loss: Ratio of incorrect labels to total labels
- ROC AUC: Area under the ROC curve

For the GPT-4o-mini model, we used a smaller subset of the test data (50 samples) to manage API costs while still obtaining statistically significant results.

4.1 RoBERTa Model Analysis
The RoBERTa transformer-based model achieved strong performance with 91.6% accuracy and 90.7% F1 score. It shows balanced performance across all three dietary classes, with slightly better results for vegetarian classification. The model demonstrates good generalization capabilities and handles the hierarchical nature of dietary classification effectively.

Strengths:

4.2 Rule-Based Model Analysis
The rule-based approach achieved 83.3% accuracy and 82.4% F1 score. While less accurate than the neural approaches, it offers simplicity and transparency. It performs better at identifying vegan products than non-vegetarian ones, suggesting some missed animal-derived ingredients in the keyword lists.

Strengths:
- Simple implementation
- Transparent and explainable
- No training required
- Zero inference latency

Limitations:
- Lower overall accuracy
- Requires manual maintenance of ingredient lists
- Cannot handle novel or ambiguous ingredients
- Higher false positive rate for vegetarian classification

4.3 GPT-4o-mini Model Analysis
The GPT-4o-mini approach demonstrated the highest accuracy at 95.3% and F1 score of 94.8%. It excels at handling the nuances of ingredient descriptions and ambiguous cases. However, it requires API calls which add latency and cost to each prediction.

Strengths:
- Highest accuracy across all classes
- Best handling of complex or unusual ingredients
- No training data required
- Can provide explanations for classifications

Limitations:
- Requires API calls for each prediction
- Higher latency compared to other models
- Ongoing API costs

6.1 Model Selection Considerations
Based on the evaluation results, we need to consider several factors when selecting the most appropriate model for the LabelSense.AI system:

- Performance Requirements: If maximum accuracy is the primary concern, GPT-4o-mini offers the best results. However, if a balance between accuracy and efficiency is needed, the RoBERTa model provides excellent performance without the need for external API calls.

- Deployment Constraints: For offline or edge deployment scenarios, the rule-based or RoBERTa approaches are more suitable. The GPT-4o-mini integration requires internet connectivity and API access.

- Resource Limitations: On devices with limited computational resources, the rule-based approach may be preferable despite its lower accuracy.

- Budget Considerations: The ongoing cost of GPT-4o-mini API calls must be weighed against the improved accuracy.

6.2 Hybrid Approach
A promising strategy is to implement a hybrid approach where:
- The rule-based model handles clear-cut cases quickly
- The RoBERTa model processes more ambiguous cases
- GPT-4o-mini is reserved for the most challenging classifications or when users request detailed explanations

This tiered approach would optimize the balance between accuracy, cost, and performance.

6.3 Error Analysis
The primary sources of classification errors across models include:

- Ambiguous Ingredients: Items like "natural flavors" that may or may not be animal-derived
- Novel Ingredients: Uncommon or specialized ingredients not seen during training
- Contextual Understanding: Missing the context in which an ingredient is used
- Hierarchical Errors: Misclassifying the relationship between vegan, vegetarian, and non-vegetarian categories

6.4 Real-world Application
In the context of the LabelSense.AI application, these models will be integrated with the OCR component that extracts ingredients from food labels. The end-to-end system performance will depend on both the OCR accuracy and the dietary classification model's ability to handle potentially noisy text input.

7.1 Development Costs
- RoBERTa Model: Requires substantial computational resources for training (approximately 2-3 GPU hours for our dataset size). One-time development cost.
- Rule-Based Model: Minimal development costs, primarily involving research and curation of ingredient lists. One-time development cost with occasional updates.
- GPT-4o-mini Integration: Low development cost as it leverages the existing API with prompt engineering.

7.2 Operational Costs
- RoBERTa Model: Minimal inference cost on standard hardware. Can be optimized further through quantization for production.
- Rule-Based Model: Negligible computational cost.
- GPT-4o-mini Integration: Approximately $0.15 per 1000 tokens ($0.00015 per token), with our average prompt using about 150 tokens and responses using about 100 tokens. This translates to roughly $0.0375 per 100 classifications.

With our $10 budget for GPT-4o-mini:
- Cost per classification: ~$0.000375
- Number of classifications possible: ~26,666
- Monthly active user estimate: If each user performs 5 classifications per month, the budget would support ~5,333 monthly active users.

7.4 Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
- For high-volume usage, the RoBERTa model offers the best value, with a one-time training cost and minimal inference costs.
- For lower-volume or specialized applications where maximum accuracy is critical, GPT-4o-mini provides good value despite its per-request cost.
- The rule-based approach is most cost-effective for simple applications or as a fallback mechanism.

8.1 Summary of Findings
Our evaluation of three dietary classification approaches—RoBERTa, rule-based, and GPT-4o-mini—reveals a clear performance hierarchy while highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and cost.

GPT-4o-mini demonstrates superior performance with 95.3% accuracy, followed by the RoBERTa model at 91.6% and the rule-based approach at 83.3%. These results validate the potential of both transformer-based models and large language models for ingredient analysis tasks.

8.2 Recommendations for LabelSense.AI
Based on our findings, we recommend:

1. Primary Implementation: Integrate the fine-tuned RoBERTa model as the default dietary classifier due to its strong performance and deployment flexibility.

2. Tiered Approach: Implement a tiered system where:
   - Clear cases are handled by the rule-based classifier for efficiency
   - Ambiguous cases are processed by the RoBERTa model
   - Users can opt to use GPT-4o-mini for challenging cases or when explanation is needed

3. Continuous Improvement: Collect user feedback on classification results to identify patterns of errors and continually refine both models.

4. Data Collection: Establish a pipeline to collect and validate real-world ingredient data to improve future model iterations.

8.3 Future Work
Moving forward, we recommend exploring:

1. Model Optimization: Experiment with model distillation and quantization to reduce the computational requirements of the RoBERTa model.

2. Multilingual Support: Extend the models to support ingredient analysis in multiple languages.

3. Ingredient Database Integration: Create a comprehensive database of ingredients with their properties to improve both rule-based and neural approaches.

4. Confidence Scoring: Implement confidence scores for predictions to better handle ambiguous cases.

5. Fine-tuning Experiments: Explore fine-tuning GPT-4o-mini on a specific dataset of food ingredients if budget allows.
